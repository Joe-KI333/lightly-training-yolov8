# 🔦 Lightly Training with YOLOv8 – Wildlife Detection

Welcome to the official repository for training efficient computer vision models using **LightlyTrain** and **YOLOv8**.  
In this project, we explore how to go from raw, unlabeled data to a well-performing object detection model using Lightly’s pretraining capabilities.

## 🧠 What is Lightly.ai?

[Lightly.ai](https://www.lightly.ai) is a computer vision platform focused on:

- Data curation  
- Model pretraining  
- Edge deployment  

Designed for real-world, industrial-scale applications, Lightly helps make AI models **faster**, **more accurate**, and **resource-efficient**.

## 🚀 What is LightlyTrain?

**LightlyTrain** is the world’s first PyTorch-based pretraining framework for industrial computer vision tasks.  
It uses **self-supervised learning (SSL)** — the same tech behind foundation models like **DINOv2** — to pretrain models **without any labeled data**.

✨ Benefits of LightlyTrain:
- No need for labeled datasets  
- YOLO-level performance  
- Faster training, lower compute cost  
- Ideal for real-world applications like object detection, segmentation, and more
